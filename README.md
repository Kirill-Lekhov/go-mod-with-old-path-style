# go-mod-with-old-path-style
This is an example of usage go mod with package import old path style

## What is this?
Once I was asked: is it possible to use `go mod` together with the old style of package imports (as in the days of using `GOPATH`, until go 1.11)?
This repository is my answer to the question.
